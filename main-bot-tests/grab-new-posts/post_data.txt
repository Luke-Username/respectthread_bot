#2019’s Cinematic Kings of Destruction: King Ghidorah (Godzilla: King Of The Monsters) vs Thanos (Avengers: Endgame) (SPOILERS FOR KOTM)
2019 have us some great Gillian’s, but only two can compare in terms of destruction and terror: these two Titans. (Partly inspired by Thanos vs Darkseid DEATH BATTLE).


King Ghidorah arrives instead of the Avengers during the Endgame. Thanos doesn’t like the hydra’s presence and decides he must reduce the dragon to atoms. Thus begins a Great War between Kings of ~~Infinity~~ Destruction.


Rules:


-Battle takes place in the same place as the Endgame final battle.


-Only use the versions specified (Ghidorah 2019, Thanos from Endgame)


Round 1: Thanos, his ship and his entire army from Endgame vs King Ghidorah. Thanos has no Infinity Stones and Ghidorah >!is not powered up (so no wing lightning moves)!<


Round 2: Depends on R1’s Winner:


-If Thanos wins, Ghidorah >!is now powered up and can pull off the wing lightning!<


-If Ghidorah wins, Thanos’s forces are doubled he receives one >!Oxygen Destroyer (King Of The Monsters)!<


Round 3: Thanos’s forces are doubled. Before the battle he defeated the Avengers and so he now wields the almighty Nano Gauntlet. However he can only use the Gauntlet as he used it in Endgame (no snap, only techniques from Endgame). Sensing the power of Thanos’s new weapon, >!Ghidorah calls out and all the Titans from Godzilla 2 heed the False King’s call!< (excluding Godzilla and Mothra of course). Who will win?!


Round 4: Round 3, but Thanos can now use the Gauntlet with the same skills from Infinity War. However, the Time Stone is not working, Ghidorah and the Titans are immune to hax, and Thanos cannot snap. The Power Stone will only work if he removes it from the Gauntlet. Who wins?


Bonus Round: Infinity War Thanos with all six stones vs Composite King Ghidorah (including the Anime Series)


BR2: Their enemies clash. Godzilla and Mothra 2019 vs all the Avengers army from Endgame. 


BR3: R1 Thanos and Ghidorah vs >!Fire Godzilla 2019!<.

#How powerful is the Origin System from Warframe?
I am wondering, just how strong are the various factions in the Warframe universe and how will they fare against other settings? I know on the ground Billions of Grineer die each year. The Grineer also have a huge industry that can build fleets of thousands of Famorians a week. The Corpus lost 100,000 ships and it did not slow them down. While we mostly know about their ground forces. Their space forces are quite harder to calculate. Hopefully the Railjack update will give us more info about Warframe's Space capabilities. But how strong is the Warframe setting?

#All Castles, Temple's, Palace's ect are all brought to life and fist fight each other. Which building wins?
Castle -  a large building, typically of the medieval period, fortified against attack with thick walls, battlements, towers, and in many cases a moat. 

Temple -  a building devoted to the worship, or regarded as the dwelling place, of a god or gods or other objects of religious reverence. 

Palace -  the official residence of a sovereign, archbishop, bishop, or other exalted person. 

&#x200B;

Any building that fits under this definition now fights each other in a fist fight.  They will seek out the closest other living building and try to kill the other.  Who is the last building standing?

No immaterials/regenerators/undead, those who can just travel to another plane to avoid the explosion, or characters who always come back to life like Deadpool.

#BattleToki Toki City Hero (Xenoverse) v Conton City Hero (Xenoverse 2)
There can only be one hero in the spotlight, and they both know this too well. They fly over to a deserted planet and prepare to settle business once and for all.

Both heroes can take advantage of their respective game mechanics (for example, if the Toki Toki City Hero is a Saiyan then they can have unlimited ki in their Super Saiyan state while Conton City Hero can take advantage of the Limit Burst mechanic) and they can only use the transformations that are available to them in the game (Toki Toki City Hero cannot go higher than Super Saiyan 2 for example); they can also only use moves that are available in their games.

The battle ground is, like stated above, on a deserted, lush planet. The battle must end in one (or I suppose both if that becomes a reality) of their deaths.

**Round 1:** Toki Toki City Hero *Saiyan* v Conton City Hero *Saiyan*

**Round 2:** Toki Toki City Hero *Earthling* v Conton City Hero *Earthling*

**Round 3:** Toki Toki City Hero *Namekian* v Conton City Hero *Namekian*

**Round 4:** Toki Toki City Hero *Frieza Clan* v Conton City Hero *Frieza Clan*

**Round 5:** Toki Toki City Hero *Majin* v Conton City Hero *Majin*

**Bonus (only applies if you have both of the games):** *Your* Toki Toki City Hero v *Your* Conton City Hero
