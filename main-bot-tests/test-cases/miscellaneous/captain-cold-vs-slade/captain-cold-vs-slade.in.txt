Arrowverse Slade Wilson vs Arrowverse Captain Cold

Contenders

Slade Wilson as of his arrival at Starling City, Mirakuru enhanced and evil as fuck.

Captain Cold as of his alliance with Heat Wave, fully equipped with his Cold Gun and outfit.

Battlefield

A heavily populated Glades, since both characters probably don't give a shit about innocent casualties anyway.

Perimeters

    Fight is to the death

    Should this fight be vastly in favor of either, give Slade 5-10 Mirakuru soldiers or Snart Heat Wave circumstantially.

    Should you see fit, feel free to give one or both characters their intel resources (e.g. Slade's huge web of spies that he built up over the years, or Snart's skeevy thug network)

Scenarios

    Slade's hunting down Snart, without Snart's knowledge.

    Snart's hunting down Slade without Slade's knowledge.

    Snart killed Shado five years ago, Slade's on the case.

Bonus: Both men have been inducted into the League of Assassins. Both have their own reasons for wanting to ascend to Ra's Al Ghul, and are now pit against each other. The various heroes/villains/anti-heroes of both Starling and Central City are now released into the scenario, allowing both combatants to approach them for help if they see fit.
