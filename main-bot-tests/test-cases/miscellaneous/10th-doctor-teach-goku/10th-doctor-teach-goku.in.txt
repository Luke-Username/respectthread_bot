Could the 10th Doctor teach Goku enough to get a perfect SAT score?

Assume he has 6 weeks (the length of a standard SAT prep class). He doesn’t get the TARDIS, though.
He can’t just steal the answers ahead of time and make Goku memorize them. He has to actually learn the material.
He can’t give Goku the answers during the test, either. The point is, no cheating is allowed.
This is current DBS Goku.
Bonus: Can he do the same with Abridged Goku?
