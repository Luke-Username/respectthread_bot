John Constantine (NBC/Arrowverse) is tasked with sealing away Lucifer Morningstar (Fox)

John Constantine has received a tip that the devil himself has been operating out of a club in Los Angeles and is tasked with sealing him away so that he can no longer influence mankind. John is not aware of Lucifer's work assisting the LAPD or his "retirement" from Hell and attempts at reformation.

Round 1: John gets one week of prep, and Lucifer does not know he's coming. He has access to any of the tools used in Constantine. The battle takes place in Lucifer's club, the Lux, with no secondary characters involved (No angelic/demonic interference or human/metahuman support for either character.) John wins if he is able to indefinitely contain Lucifer using any of the techniques at his disposal. Lucifer wins if John dies or is dissuaded from coming after him.

Round 2: Lucifer knows John is coming and has the same period of prep time. Both opponents can recruit characters from their respective shows to help. John is only allowed assistance from Constantine characters, however, meaning no Arrowverse.

Round 3: Same as Round 2, but with Earth-1 Arrowverse allowed. (Allowing the entire Arrowverse would mean bringing in Earth 38. I'm not pitting Lucifer against Superman, as that's another WWW entirely.)

Bonus Round: Both combatants are replaced by their counterparts from the Hellblazer continuity. Is there any way John can still pull it off?
