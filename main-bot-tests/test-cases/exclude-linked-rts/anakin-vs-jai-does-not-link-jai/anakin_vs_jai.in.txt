Anakin Skywalker and 100 Storm Troopers vs force Immune Prince Jai and his Golden Army

Prince Jai and his army are completely immune to anakins forced based attacks such as force choke, push, etc. 

[Respect Prince Jai](https://www.reddit.com/r/respectthreads/comments/5ype7y/respect_prince_jai_curse_of_the_golden_flower/)

Jai's army is 10,000 strong. 

**Canon Skywalker from revenge of the sith.**

What happens if this battle took place in an open field with some large trees scattered about ? 

Anakin goes in extremely confident with his storm troopers. (not expecting his powers won't work)

**Bonus Round** : a force immune Legolas from LOTR joins Jai.. What happens
