Could Rapunzel clear the entirety of DOOM 2016? 

Rapunzel's respect thread

For one reason or another, the person that finds themselves on the operation table on Mars in the beginning of Doom 2016 is not the Doom Slayer himself, but the Princess of Corona, Rapunzel. She has no memory of how she got there, why she's there at all, or even where she is, but she does know she has to fight to survive the forces of hell that broke into the station, and conquer hell itself from those demons. With no help from Eugene, Pascal or any other of her friends, could she be able to do so?

Round 1: Using only her frying pan and the healing abilities her hair grants her, could she clear DOOM 2016?

Round 2: Same as R1, but she also can use the same arsenal and runes that the Doom Slayer has in Doom 2016, including the chainsaw gun, and the BFG. (However, she does not know how to use them)

Round 3: Same as Round 2, but she has advance knowledge and training of the Doom Slayer's arsenal. She also has Pascal to help her.

BONUS: Rapunzel with Doom Slayer's arsenal vs Doom Slayer with only Rapunzel's frying pan. Who would win in a battle?

Bruce Wayne dropped into the Hunger Games, but he has to keep everyone alive.

As the title suggests, a mature Bruce is dropped into the hunger games arena 1 minute before it starts he has no gear, and is wearing normal clothes. Can he stop all 24 kids from either killing each other or being killed by the environmental traps. His goal is to stalemate the games similar to how Katniss did it but with a 24 way tie if possible. He wins if he is able to tie up all 24 kids all in center where there are no traps. He can incapacitate the kids, but no permanent injuries and he cant use any of the weapons except for 100ft of rope. Also, the kids dont know why he is there so they obviously dont trust him.

Weakest fictional nation that can defeat Nazi Germany(WW2)? 

What is the weakest fictional country that can defeat the full force of the Nazi war machine?

Nazi Germany at it's peak military might is teleported to a reasonable spot geographically adjacent to their opponent. (You can pick the exact year/date of Nazi Germany)

Nazi Germany spends a month preparing before launching an all out assault on their opponent.

Nazi Germany has a year's worth of supplies and can capture/produce more. (I.E. They won't run out of gas after the first month in Middle Earth unless shenanigans are involved.)

The opponent country has to survive the invasion, and take Berlin within 5 years to win the prompt.

Sorry if details are a little vague, but I think you get the idea of what I'm asking right? I can provide more details if you ask though.

#2019’s Cinematic Kings of Destruction: King Ghidorah (Godzilla: King Of The Monsters) vs Thanos (Avengers: Endgame) (SPOILERS FOR KOTM)
2019 have us some great Gillian’s, but only two can compare in terms of destruction and terror: these two Titans. (Partly inspired by Thanos vs Darkseid DEATH BATTLE).


King Ghidorah arrives instead of the Avengers during the Endgame. Thanos doesn’t like the hydra’s presence and decides he must reduce the dragon to atoms. Thus begins a Great War between Kings of ~~Infinity~~ Destruction.


Rules:


-Battle takes place in the same place as the Endgame final battle.


-Only use the versions specified (Ghidorah 2019, Thanos from Endgame)


Round 1: Thanos, his ship and his entire army from Endgame vs King Ghidorah. Thanos has no Infinity Stones and Ghidorah >!is not powered up (so no wing lightning moves)!<


Round 2: Depends on R1’s Winner:


-If Thanos wins, Ghidorah >!is now powered up and can pull off the wing lightning!<


-If Ghidorah wins, Thanos’s forces are doubled he receives one >!Oxygen Destroyer (King Of The Monsters)!<


Round 3: Thanos’s forces are doubled. Before the battle he defeated the Avengers and so he now wields the almighty Nano Gauntlet. However he can only use the Gauntlet as he used it in Endgame (no snap, only techniques from Endgame). Sensing the power of Thanos’s new weapon, >!Ghidorah calls out and all the Titans from Godzilla 2 heed the False King’s call!< (excluding Godzilla and Mothra of course). Who will win?!


Round 4: Round 3, but Thanos can now use the Gauntlet with the same skills from Infinity War. However, the Time Stone is not working, Ghidorah and the Titans are immune to hax, and Thanos cannot snap. The Power Stone will only work if he removes it from the Gauntlet. Who wins?


Bonus Round: Infinity War Thanos with all six stones vs Composite King Ghidorah (including the Anime Series)


BR2: Their enemies clash. Godzilla and Mothra 2019 vs all the Avengers army from Endgame. 


BR3: R1 Thanos and Ghidorah vs >!Fire Godzilla 2019!<.

I am wondering, just how strong are the various factions in the Warframe universe and how will they fare against other settings? I know on the ground Billions of Grineer die each year. The Grineer also have a huge industry that can build fleets of thousands of Famorians a week. The Corpus lost 100,000 ships and it did not slow them down.

#All Castles, Temple's, Palace's ect are all brought to life and fist fight each other. Which building wins?
Castle -  a large building, typically of the medieval period, fortified against attack with thick walls, battlements, towers, and in many cases a moat. 

Temple -  a building devoted to the worship, or regarded as the dwelling place, of a god or gods or other objects of religious reverence. 

Palace -  the official residence of a sovereign, archbishop, bishop, or other exalted person. 

&#x200B;

Any building that fits under this definition now fights each other in a fist fight.  They will seek out the closest other living building and try to kill the other.  Who is the last building standing?

#BattleToki Toki City Hero (Xenoverse) v Conton City Hero (Xenoverse 2)
There can only be one hero in the spotlight, and they both know this too well. They fly over to a deserted planet and prepare to settle business once and for all.

Both heroes can take advantage of their respective game mechanics (for example, if the Toki Toki City Hero is a Saiyan then they can have unlimited ki in their Super Saiyan state while Conton City Hero can take advantage of the Limit Burst mechanic) and they can only use the transformations that are available to them in the game (Toki Toki City Hero cannot go higher than Super Saiyan 2 for example); they can also only use moves that are available in their games.

The battle ground is, like stated above, on a deserted, lush planet. The battle must end in one (or I suppose both if that becomes a reality) of their deaths.

**Round 1:** Toki Toki City Hero *Saiyan* v Conton City Hero *Saiyan*

(616) Spider-Man becomes a serial killer, how long until he is caught?

Title pretty much says all (I might have made a grammar mistake). Bloodlusted 616 Spider-Man appears in 2019 Earth, in a random city in the United States which may or may not be New York. His goal being to get as many kills as possible without getting caught/killed/exposed as Peter Parker.

​

He only has standard equipment. There are no other super powered beings to stop him. And for the sake of it, let's have this take place in an alternate universe where Spider-Man was never published as a fictional character, kinda like The Walking Dead. So at the start of the Spider-Man rampage, nobody recognizes him as Spider-Man.

​

How many kills can he get?

I think within a universe, Iron Man generally has the edge over Spider-Man, but the movie heroes are weaker than their comic counterparts, so I'm curious to see how this goes. Battleground is the streets of New York, standard loadout, no prep.

Maxwell respect thread

Maxwell is given 2 seconds to open his notebook before the others can do anything. His notebook completely stops time when used, and no-one else but him is immune to that effect

He can use everything he can in all his games (summons, adjectives etc), and "massively faster than light" is added to his list of adjectives as well, to prevent speedblizzed BFR. He, and all others, are bloodlusted

R1: maxwell vs an army composed of all other playable characters in gaming who have a body of some kind. For example, his enemies include azura, Goku, superman, and the player in 'megaton rainfall', but does not include whatever entity you control in "universe sandbox"

R2: same as before, but with a thousand copies of each opponent

R3: instead of seperate characters, Maxwell fights a character with the composite Powers from every previous opponent

R4: same as R1, but everyone has excess to any glitch, exploit, bug, cheat, or console command in their respective games. Maxwell's adjectives overpower console commands though. The dragonborn can't just click and delete him if he has the "Immortal" adjective

R5: same as round 4 but the notebook doesn't overpower the console

Team Coulson (Marvel's Agents of SHIELD) vs. Slade (Arrowverse)

So in my last post with Slade everyone pretty much agreed that Widow was outclassed, so I figured instead of one badass agent why not make it a team? So Team Coulson is going to be the classic team of Ward, Mae, Fitz, Simmons, Skye, and Coulson from a few episodes before everything went to shit so that this team is now pretty well oiled and work very well together at this point.

Anyways, let's say that Team Arrow is temporarily out of action so Fury has to send in his favorite team to sort this out. Because this is Arrowverse/takes place in Starling assume there can be no SHIELD back up for the team, but they are government agents so they can probably reach out for help.. For tech, basically anything FitzSimmons can whip up and intelligence anything Skye can hack and make use of.

For a fun little bonus, let's say Slade has Team Arrow somewhere to screw with Oliver before killing him so you can have Coulson's group stumble across them if you want

Last thing: I also just want to mention Team Coulson is very experienced in fighting actual superhumans and usually do well for themselves

Green Arrow(Oliver Queen; Arrowverse: Earth 1) vs The GCPD(Gotham) vs Oswald Cobblepot and his gang

So... I posted this a while back and no one really responded to it so I thought I’d give it another try.

Green Arrow is trying to assasinate Penguin in the city of Gotham. Penguin is as of season 4, so is the GCPD, and so is the city of Gotham. Green Arrow’s job is to kill Penguin. In order to do this, Oliver must be able to say “OSWALT COBBLEPOT, YOU HAVE FAILED THIS CITY” before he kills him. Oliver can and will question anyone he feels knows about penguins whereabouts. Oliver may not leave the city until Penguin is assasinated. Oliver has no outside contact so he cannot contact Felicity, Roy, Diggle, Thea, etc.

Penguin has all of his goons to try to stop Oliver. Penguin’s goal is to either kill green arrow before he gets to him or have the GCPD capture Green Arrow before green arrow kills him. Penguin can hide his goons among the people in order to pass info. Penguin has all of his own resources.

Jim Gordon leads a strike team that is trying to track down and stop green arrow, knowing he is going to assasinate penguin. Jim may ask anyone he thinks is a witness. Jim’s goal is to arrest and bring Oliver in, ALIVE. Jim may also send spies among the people to try to get information about Oliver. He has all of the resources of the GCPD at his disposal. Bonus points if Jim is able to arrest Oswalt.

Other Rules: 1. Any party may question any standbys about anything. 2. No one may leave the city until they win. 3. green Arrow/Oliver Queen wins if he is able to say “Oswalt cobblepot, you have failed this city!” And then kill Penguin/Oswalt and then leave the city ALIVE. If Oliver dies or is arrested, he loses. 4. Penguin wins if he is able to KILL Oliver/get Oliver killed, this does not include Oliver’s arrest. If Oliver is arrested or Penguin himself is killed, Penguin loses. 5. Jim Gordon wins if he is able to ARREST Oliver, not kill him. If Oliver or Oswalt die, Jim loses. If Jim arrests both Oliver and Oswalt, he gets bonus points. 6. Oliver starts at the GCPD and so does Jim’s strike team but Oliver gets a 1 hour head start. Once Oliver leaves, Penguin is informed an attempt on his life is about to be made.

R1: No changes to the rules

R2: Jim Gordon enlists the help of Bruce Wayne/The Gotham Vigilante and Alfred Pennyworth to catch Oliver.

R3: Oliver gets the help of Bruce Wayne/The Gotham Vigilante but if Bruce finds out Oliver means to kill Penguin, Bruce will attempt to turn Oliver into the GCPD.

R4: Oliver gets the help of Selina Kyle/Catwoman

R5: Jim Gordon gets the help of Catwoman.

I’m also going to put a few more rules in place to make this more balanced and make the fight better.

    all kryptonians are weak to magic just as mentioned in the comics even if it has not been mentioned in the continuities they’re from.

    Wonder Woman, despite it not being mentioned in the DCEU, is still able to be killed via stabbing just like in the comics.

    They do not have access to outside contacts.

    Any Batman that is present within this fight has access to kryptonite no matter what the continuity.

    Whether or not it was mentioned in the continuity they are apart of, Barry Allen is a forensic scientist for the CCPD as a day job.

    Bruce Wayne from season five of Gotham will be in some rounds. He now goes by the name Batman and he wears Kevlar, has a fireproof cape, but his face is visible. He has access to all of the gadgets that his TDK/nolanverse counterpart does as well. He also has a kryptonite ring, the same one Batman does in the comics.

    Characters can use the items around themselves as weaponry.

    Try to explain how you believe the fights would go.

Now here are the rounds. I tried to make these as interesting as possible:

R1: the fight takes place in Metropolis. Both Clark Kent from the Arrowverse and from the DCEU recognize metropolis as if it were Home. No one is present in the entire city but the combatants. The fight begins at the daily planet. They cannot leave metropolis at all.

R2: The fight takes place in Central City. Both Barry from the Arrowverse and Barry from the DCEU recognize it just like Home. No one is present in the entire city except for the combatants. The fight starts at the CCPD. No combatant may leave Central City.

R3: The fight takes place in Starling City from the Arrowverse. No one except the combatants is present. The fight starts at the Queen Mansion. No combatant may leave Starling City.

R4: Same as R1 but Bruce Wayne from Season 5 of Gotham has joined the Arrowverse Justice league side and Green Arrow has been removed(I’m aware Gotham isn’t part of the arrowverse).

R5: same as R2 but Bruce Wayne from Season 5 of Gotham is now on the side of the Arrowverse and Green Arrow is removed

R6: The fight takes place in Gotham City and Bruce Wayne from season 5 of Gotham replaces Oliver on the Arrowverse team again. Both Bruce Waynes and Batwoman recognize Gotham like Home. The fight starts at the GCPD. No one is present within Gotham city except for the combatants. No one may leave Gotham city.

R7(bonus): Same as R3 but Bruce Wayne from season 5 of Gotham replaces Batflek on the DCEU Justice league.

R8(bonus): same as R3 but Barry and Oliver have switched bodies like in elseworlds.

Supergirl vs Green Arrow (CW)

Kara is in town and drops by Big Belly Burger to join Oliver and Thea for lunch. She is then magically possessed, turns toward Oliver, says "hey you wanna see something funny?", snaps Thea's neck, and flies off to continue crimefighting.

The magic placed on Kara erases her memory of killing Thea. It also makes it so that any time someone talks about Thea she hears "my French fry" and any form or synonym of "to kill" is heard as an equivalent form or synonym of "to eat". Finally, it makes Kara obsessed with convincing Oliver to change his last name from Queen to Princess because she thinks it would be super cute and/or funny. Otherwise she's fully in character.

Oliver, meanwhile, has become consumed with rage and vengeance and decided to kill Kara. After a few days of prep, he confronts her.

Supergirl wins if Arrow non-sarcastically agrees to change his last name, gives up on killing her, or dies / loses consciousness. Arrow wins if he kills Supergirl.

MCU as he Appears in Far From Home, he does not have EDITH or the IronSpider Suit.

[Mild Flash, Arrow, and AoS Spoilers] Team Flarrow v Secret Warriors

Alright, alright, alright, my [original post] (https://www.reddit.com/r/shield/comments/3x7xvj/mild_flarrow_mcu_spoilers_flarrowverse_v_mcu/) “Flarrowverse v MCU” got some pushback because of how much of a stronger power set the MCU Avengers has over the characters from *Flash* and *Arrow*. While I don’t necessarily agree, I can understand their perspective, and thought I’d post an alternative “versus” discussion.

I know everyone’s a little glum about the holiday hiatus of our favorite respective superhero shows, but there’s been a lot of hype in the last two weeks for upcoming superhero films, and I wanted to play off that. A common theme for the 2016 superhero film lineup is “versus”: Batman v Superman, Iron Man v Captain America, X-Men v X-Men. Since it’s so popular, I’d like your opinion of my own battle: Flarrowverse’s Teams Flash and Arrow v *AoS*’s Secret Warriors

__

*On Teams Flash and Arrow*

Ollie / Green Arrow

Thea / Speedy

Diggle / Black Driver

Ray / Atom

Laurel / Black Canary

Sara / White Canary

Barry / Flash

Jax and Stein / Firestorm

__

*On The Secret Warriors*

Daisy / Quake

Coulson

Mack (with a shotgun/axe)

Hunter

Bobbi / Mockingbird

May / The Calvary

Lincoln / “Love Interest”

Joey / “Jet Fuel”

__

I went with the current, most active characters in their respective universes to form an 8v8 team. 

*The scenario*: both teams have a GENERAL knowledge about each other, based data retrieved from Fitz, Simmons, Felicity, Cisco, and E-2 Wells. 

*The environment*: Downtown metropolitan area. All civilians have been evacuated, so there’s no concern about public safety (looking your way, *Man of Steel*).

*The background*: The Flarrowverse characters are often good strategists and definitely have a diverse power and skill set, but can be plagued by their emotions and naiveté in battle. Coulson’s team, while underpowered in comparison, tend to play the long con much more successfully, and make good use of their tools and resources.

Who would choose to fight each other? Which characters would overpower the others? Which team would win? Who would be left standing? Paint me your idea of how the battle would go! 

:)

__

EDIT: Based on a recommendation by "TheRappture", I'd like to modify the Marvel team to incorporate *all* MCU shows and better even out the teams. So what we're gonna do is take out Mack, Hunter, and Coulson, and replace them with...

Matt / Daredevil

Jessica Jones

Luke Cage

__

Ready, set, go!

The Arrow vs The Flash ladder.

I'm a big fan of both Arrow and The Flash tv shows so here I am with the idea, the Arrow vs the Flashes Rogue gallery thus far both dead and alive. 

The Arrow has all of his trick arrows used in the series vs. 1) Clyde Mardon 2) Danton Black 3) Kyle Nimbus 4) Leonard Snart "Captain Cold" 5) [new one](#spoil "Tony Woodward")*Don't look if you haven't seen the latest episode. Ollie gets a day prep time for each rogue. With Felicity and Diggle helping behind the scenes

List of Trick Arrows used so far: 
Router arrow: Shot near computers to hack into them. One is used in "Pilot" to steal money from a corrupt businessman Adam Hunt.

Grappling Hook arrow: To grab on to ledges for swing lines and zip lines. Used in "Pilot" and many other episodes. The new "Oneida Kestrel Compound Bow" has a device that allows him to pull arrow hook by an automated way, thus being able to climb on flat surfaces in a matter of seconds.

Voice recording/Listening arrow: Recording and Listening devices for recording confessions and surveillance. They are used in "Honor Thy Father", "Betrayal", and "The Undertaking".

Ensnarement arrow: After piercing a target it launches wires into the area around the target and then pulls them tight. Used in "Legacies" to anchor dropped bags of money to the ground to prevent them from being carried off by bank robbers.

Flashbang arrow: A flashbang grenade in the form of an arrow. They are used in "Vendetta" to disorient drug dealers at the beginning of an attack, to distract a hostage taker in "The Undertaking", and to explode in Malcolm Merlyn's face after he caught it during his and Oliver's last duel in "Sacrifice". 

Explosive arrow: Explosive arrows, both time-delayed and impact, are used in "Year's End" to blow a door, and in "Dodger" and "The Huntress Returns" to disable moving cars.

Flare/Flame burst arrow: They create a burst of fire. One is used in "Betrayal" to blind snipers.
Tranquilizer mini-dart arrow: Small dart thrown to deliver a sedative. One was thrown at Detective Quentin Lance to disable him while escaping the police station in "The Huntress Returns".
Incendiary arrow: They are used to burn through the seal in a grate to get into the subway, as seen in "Salvation".

Remote detonator arrow: Explosive arrow that can be detonated by remote control. One is used to distract drug dealing doctors and escape from being strapped to a chair in "Unfinished Business".

Syringe arrow: An arrow with a syringe in the tip to inject liquids into target. One is used to inject an herb solution to counteract a drug overdose given to Oliver in "Unfinished Business". It was also used in "State v. Queen" and "Deathstroke"

Scenario 2: Arsenal joins the fray
Scenario 3: Malcolm Merlin makes the Archer Trifecta

The Doctor vs Galactus

Hello, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Cazidin and today I ask one simple question. If Galactus came to devour Earth as his next celestial meal could the Doctor somehow save them or sate his appetite in a way that Reed Richards, Super Genius, could not?

R1:4th incarnation armed with jelly babies and doom-scarf.

R2:7th incarnation armed with unlimited tapioca pudding and something vaguely 80's.

R3:10 & 11 working together, armed with... a fez and a mop?

R4:12 armed with sunglasses and a rock guitar.

BONUS ROUND: Unit has to deal with it because the Doctor is currently away at an alien spa where the mud is actually alive and is absorbing the rich, and also one of his companions. That's unimportant for the sake of this prompt.

John Constantine has received a tip that the devil himself has been operating out of a club in Los Angeles and is tasked with sealing him away so that he can no longer influence mankind. John is not aware of Lucifer's work assisting the LAPD or his "retirement" from Hell and attempts at reformation.

Round 1: John gets one week of prep, and Lucifer does not know he's coming. He has access to any of the tools used in Constantine. The battle takes place in Lucifer's club, the Lux, with no secondary characters involved (No angelic/demonic interference or human/metahuman support for either character.) John wins if he is able to indefinitely contain Lucifer using any of the techniques at his disposal. Lucifer wins if John dies or is dissuaded from coming after him.

Round 2: Lucifer knows John is coming and has the same period of prep time. Both opponents can recruit characters from their respective shows to help. John is only allowed assistance from Constantine characters, however, meaning no Arrowverse.

Round 3: Same as Round 2, but with Earth-1 Arrowverse allowed. (Allowing the entire Arrowverse would mean bringing in Earth 38. I'm not pitting Lucifer against Superman, as that's another WWW entirely.)

Bonus Round: Both combatants are replaced by their counterparts from the Hellblazer continuity. Is there any way John can still pull it off?

Characters who can imitate God

So a character of your choice comes down to Earth and must convince us that they are an omnipotent, omniscient being. They can't mind control or coerce us into believing this - they have to be convincing, and we must be allowed to ask them questions and demand answers.

1. Convince the large majority of people from the 13th century.
   1. EDIT 1a: convince the large majority of philosophers and intellectuals from the 13th century.
2. Convince the large majority of people from the modern post-industrial world.
3. Make disproving their claim impossible to even the most dedicated and astute people today.

Which characters do you think are just at the threshold for being able to do this?

Composite live-action Bruce Wayne vs Composite live-action Peter Parker

Please, do not turn Adam West into a joke. Take his feats seriously as they're presented, not as the meme suggests. Any mention of "anti-spider spray" will be considered shitposting and reported.

Every live-action depiction ever of Bruce Wayne pool their collective feats, skills, and gadgets into a single character.

And every live-action Peter Parker does the same, with feats, tech, and abilities from all of them applying equally.

Round 1: Chance encounter in downtown Philadelphia.

Round 2: Bruce gets a day of prep time. Peter gets two weeks.

Round 3: They fight in an open field instead with no obstructions. Standard equipment.

Round 4: Open field again, both now Bloodlusted, and with prep time again.

Bonus: They both team up to defeat Composite live-action Wonder Woman. Can they do it?

Just wondering who would win in Hodor vs Mountain.

R1: Hand to hand combat, to death.

If it matters do both rounds book or show feats.

R3: For fun, can the mountain, the hound and hodor team up to kill wun wun in hand to hand combat.

Bill Cipher(Gravity Falls) VS. Beerus(Dragon Ball)

One gloomy day, a purple, mighty cat was about to destroy planet Earth once and for all. The cat goes by the name, Beerus. He charged up a deadly KI Ball, and shot it at the blue planet. Until, suddenly, a yellow, one-eyed triangle appeared, but right in front of it. The demon, by the name Bill Cipher, didn’t react in time, and it hit him right in the one eye. “Ow, my eye!” Bill Cipher wailed. He then regenerated it, while in a completely dazed state. “Hm, another being, standing in my way? You seem quite interesting...” Beerus said. “Thank you! I’m truly honored to be your entertainment!” Bill said as he bowed while putting on a bow tie. “Enough chit chat! You blocked by attempt at destroying this puny planet! And because of that, you’ll have to pay the price!” Beerus responded. “How much? I have all the money in the world!” Bill replied while pulling out a bunch of dollars. “THE PRICE OF YOUR LIFE!” Beerus yells back. “Show me your strength, triangle!” “Aw, you could have used the cash! No matter. I’ll just have to finish you, due to your request!” Bill says back. “Challenge accepted!” Beerus cockily replies.

R1: No bloodlust

R2: Bloodlusted

Facehugger vs Darth Vader's helmet

Let's say, Vader was caught off guard and a facehugger manages to attach itself to Vader's helmet.

Would Vader's helmet be able to withstand molecular acid that can burn into five decks on a spaceship in seconds? It was established in the original Alien, the facehugger that attacked Kane uses acid blood to burn through Kane's helmet.

If the facehugger manages to break through Vader's helmet and attaches itself on Vader's face and neck, thereby smothering and choking him, would Vader manage to remove it before embryo implantation.

Because the host's genetic code, e.g. Midichlorians, is incorporated into the chestburster during incubation, would that mean that the resulting Xenomorph would have the same level of Midichlorians that Vader has?
