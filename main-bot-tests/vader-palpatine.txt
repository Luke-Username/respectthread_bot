Where would a master Jedi such as Kenobi or Skywalker fit in the DC/Marvel power structure/level of heroes?

Where or how would one fit in with the Avengers or the Justice League? Which are they more or less powerful than? What might a Jedi's role be in defeating Thanos or Galactus?

What about a Sith's (Vader or Palpatine) place among the villains in each universe?
