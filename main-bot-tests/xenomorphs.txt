Can Logan clear Hadley's Hope

Scenario:  Weyland-Yutani lost contact with Hadley's Hope. After analyzing the situation, corporate determines the colony to be under siege.

However, unlike the movie, where the marines were called in,  Weyland-Yutani wants this done off the books. They hire an independent mercenary - Logan. He is dropped onto the planet with the spaceship equivalent of a honda civic and no weapons, under the official guise of being a courier.

His mission is as follows:

* Neutralize any hostile threats
* Bonus situation: Retrieve at least three specimens for the bio-weapons division. This can be in any usable form (face-huggers, eggs, impregnated humans)

In the facility, he encounters the same scenario as in the movie Aliens, including Newt, the Xenomorphs/Queen, and the cocooned victims. 

For the context of the battle, he has "modern" knowledge and is not a man out of time.

How does he fare in character?

* R1: From the start of the movie "Logan"
* R2: From the movie "Wolverine"
* R3: From the X-Men cartoon
* R4: 616 (with adamantium claws)
