Could Batman save everyone from dying in Final Destination?

Batman does a 24hr binge on all the Final Destination movies and lore before falling asleep and getting Isekai'd into the film. He starts at the airport in the first movie with the main cast. Because of the movie binge, Batman is extra motivated to keep everyone alive and knows everything that's going to happen. After completing the events of one movie, he gets Isekai'd to the sequel and has to save everyone again.

Round 1: Batman must save all main cast members from death in each movie.

Round 2: Batman can only allow 1 death per movie.

Round 3: Batman is also being pursued by death and must save at least 1 other person in each movie while also trying to survive till the end.

Can Batman cheat death on a scale like this?
