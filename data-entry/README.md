Scripts and files here are used to enter data into the database.
Most Python files here should have comments explaining their use.

`data_to_insert.py` is used most often for when new respect threads are posted 
(https://www.reddit.com/r/respectthreads/new/).

`export_tables.py` exports the database data to the `csv-data` folder, as a backup.
